        <h2 class="backstory" id="backstory">Backstory</h2>
        <p>My name is Hunter Allen Tulius, cool initials right, I was born in 2003 in la crosse WI and lived the first half of my life in Independence WI population 1,477. My mother was very young when she had me, so I was raised by my grandparents until my mom was ready to take care of me. Freshman year of high school I moved in with my mom in Whitehall WI, a town just slightly bigger. After high school I got accepted to UT Dallas, but it was too expensive to go, so I fell back on my second choice UW Madison, but again couldn’t afford it. Luckily UW Eau Claire was still taking application in mid-august, and I quickly got in, and I now I love it here.</p>
        <h3>Passions & Goals</h3>
        <p>I don’t have much I’m really passionate about but the few things I am, I really am. I absolutely love video games and I make sure to find any time I can to sit down and play a few hours. I also love the news, particularly on the ground reporting, which is my dream job, especially a war correspondent. Videography goes with that heavily and so I’ve been getting more and more into those types of mediums. My goal is to get into some sort of news position by the time I graduate and just work my way to that dream eventually.</p>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>My high school wasn’t the best having no more than 40 kids in a grade doesn’t lead to the best funding. Independence High was able to give me a fairly good education, however. The school worked really hard to give its students the best and got really creative with how they reached those goals. I learned a lot from some of the best teachers I know, all because they cared deeply about the students and wanted to see us succeed. I hope to go back there some day as an alumnus. My college education I would say is very similar, UWEC isn’t the biggest school out their, but they know that and don’t try to act like they’re the best. The school focuses on what’s best for students and it really shows in the education and other experiences of the school. I don’t regret either of these schools as my choice and would do pick both again in a heartbeat.</p>
        <h2 class="achievements" id="achievements">Achievements</h2>
        <p>I don’t have any real awards that I can think of, there were some I got in high school but nothing extra exciting. There was always some other student doing just a little best than me so I never got many awards or certificates, but I have plenty of personal achievements. I’ve be a A-B student through all my years of school, except for a C in Spanish during Covid but we don’t need to talk about that. And I’ve always been proud of things I have made and if I wasn’t I always found a way to improve the final product. I pride myself in my ability to take in information, even If I don’t like it, and work to make the best of the situation. Personally, I don’t think I need physical awards to know my strengths and if others, whether it’s a job of a school, don’t trust me they can find someone else.</p>
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>Right now, I don’t have the best work experience in the fields I want but that because I’m focusing on school. I worked for years on a family farm and now have a few years at Kwik Trip. Both these jobs may not be in the field, but they have given me a good work ethic and tons of other valuable life lessons.</p>

        <p>In this section, I show some of my most important pieces of work from my time in college. First is a profile piece on a local man running for political office, Second is an article on a Trempealeau County board meeting, Third is a research paper on Roe V Wade discussing its overturning, Fourth is a poster ad for a Women Farmers Of Wisconsin (fictional for project), and Finally is a promotional video for an outdoors club at UWEC (fictional for project). </p>
